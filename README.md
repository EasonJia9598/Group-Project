# Application


##1. Welcome page finish. 
      #group_A add brief.
      
      
      #3D animation:
      1. Two init and render failed. Converting video type mov to webM and start autoplay each time.
      2. Second init success, perspective will be dynamically changing by mouse position.
      3. Background music added.
      4. Encapsulation of changing Model funcion need to be done at next release.
      
##2. Server connecting done.
      group_C add brief.
      
      
##3. Deep breath unfinish.
      #group_B add brief.
      
     #3D animation:
      1. Now, deep breath could change duration time.
      2. Can start again.
      3. Can focus on concentration mode.
      4. Still Linear equation.
      5. Already figure out changeing formual of time, zoom in/out. And already encapsulation changing funcions.
      6. Add background music:
            1. concentration music
            2. inhale music
            3. exhale music
            4. compeleted music
      7. Have optimized compeleting cicle with loop times by encapsulation func.
      8. Time changing by 2 * time + 4/6/5;
      9. scale increasing/decreasing by 0.015
      10.camera positon:
              camera.position.x = 300;
              camera.position.y = 300;
              camera.position.z = 900;
      11.Add nav bar.
##4. Flying house:
     #3D animation:
      1. Add two camera into one scene.
         a. One look at background picture.
         b. One look at object.
      2. Model free changing.
      3. Mouse position control it moving.
      4. Add music directly in WebGL level.
      5. Add nav bar.
